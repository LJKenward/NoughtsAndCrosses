# Project Brief

The client *(DT, which is short for Dream Terminator)* required a web application built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the ever thrilling game, **Tic, Tac, Toe**.

## Technical Requirements For First Deployment

- [x] The game must allow two players to compete against eachother. 
- [ ] Render a game board in the browser
- [ ] Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- [ ] Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/cat’s game if neither does
- [ ] Have separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- [ ] Use jQuery and/or pure javascript DOM API for DOM manipulation
- [ ] Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
- [ ] Be deployed on a host somewhere where the rest of the world can see it
- [ ] Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### My Goal

To develope a simple game that is playable by all age groups. By combining a world wide love for Pho, a traditional Vietnamese dish, **Tic Tac Pho** is easy is navigate and leaves the user with a strong desire to eat Pho, essentially working towards boosting the Pho market around the world.

### Strategy 

1. Develope Basic Wireframes for UI. 
*This involved looking for a design that would be easy to resize for difference digital devices.*

2. Develope a simple code base to get to a basic working prototype.

3. Work on the style and visual interface of the game.

4. Deploy a working version. 

5. Further devlope functionality 

6. Finalise Project

### Road Map 

- [ ] Use timers to display "waiting..." messages while users are waiting to be matched
- [ ] Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
- [ ] Allow game customizable options, time limits, number of cards, board size, game rounds, name & profiles etc
- [ ] Allow players to customize their token (X, O, name, picture, avatar etc)
- [ ] Get inventive with your styling ** use CSS effects or animations to spiff things up
- [ ] Use LocalStorage or SessionStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
- [ ] Be creative with the game, bend the rules, give it a twist
- [ ] Connect to a prebuilt backend service for persistence (research firebase and try some of their examples)
