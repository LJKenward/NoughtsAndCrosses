WDI 6 Iterm8s Project One - Noughts and Crosses Game - Web

# Project Brief

The client *(DT, which stands for Dream Terminator)* required a web application built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the game **Tic, Tac, Toe** or where I grew up **Noughts and Crosses**.

## Technical Requirements

The game must allow two players to compete against eachother. 
Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/cat’s game if neither does
Have separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Use jQuery and/or pure javascript DOM API for DOM manipulation
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
Be deployed on a host somewhere where the rest of the world can see it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
